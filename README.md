“We are statistical and population geneticists interested in the confluence of epidemiology, AI and evolution. We use simulations, new methods, and large-scale datasets to improve personalized medicine. We are interested in improving risk prediction across the spectrum of diversity of human populations, integrating insights from functional genomics, and identifying the clinical and translational potential of modern genomics.”

## Overview

This repo contains the workshop material for using R/tidyverse to
analyze & visualize diverse datasets, *e.g.,*
[transcriptomics](https://github.com/jananiravi/workshop-tidyverse/tree/master/transcriptomics),
[gapminder](https://github.com/jananiravi/workshop-tidyverse/tree/master/gapminder)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to load your genomic
dataset, perform basic data tidying & wrangling, data visualization, and
save/export your results using `tidyverse`! Hopefully, you will also
have a newfound appreciation for reproducible research and R!

## Setup

### Before the Workshop Begins

1.  Install the following software if you don't yet have them. If you do
    have these installed, skip to #2:
    1.  **R** version `3.6+` (Current: `4.2.0`) \| [Download
        R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    2.  **RStudio** version `1.3+` (Current: `2022.02.2-485`) \|
        [Download
        RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) OR
        use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
2.  Ensure that your version of **R** is `3.6+`. The latest version is
    `4.2.0`. To check your R version, type in your console: `version`
3.  Check your **RStudio** version. It should be `v1.3+` Open RStudio.
    In the top menu bar click: RStudio \> About RStudio \>
4.  Install **tidyverse**, **here**, **gapminder** (not needed for
    transcriptomics workshop), **gganimate**: <br>
    `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "gapminder"))` <br>
    `devtools::install_github(‘thomasp85/gganimate’)`
5.  Access useful [Cheatsheets
    here](https://github.com/jananiravi/cheatsheets).

and R Studio**

#### For Windows Users

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU) <br>
Install R by downloading and running [this `.exe` file from
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm). Also,
please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Note
that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur
later, for example when installing R packages.

#### For Mac Users

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg) Install R
by downloading and running [this `.pkg` file from
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg). Also, please
install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

#### For Linux Users

You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your
package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run
`sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`).
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
